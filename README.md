# Venn-ABERS Predictor
*(Preliminary documentation)*

The `VennABERS.py` file is a pure Python implementation of the fast Venn-ABERS Predictor described in
[Vovk2015](http://alrw.net/articles/13.pdf).

A Venn-ABERS predictor outputs two probability predictions for every test object.
In particular, the Venn-ABERS predictor implemented here is the inductive form of probability predictor, which relies on a calibration set.
In a nutshell, the Venn-ABERS predictor can be viewed as a distribution-free calibration function that maps scores output by a *scoring classifier* to well-calibrated probabilities.
A gentle introduction can be found in this [tutorial](https://cml.rhul.ac.uk/people/ptocca/HomePage/Toccaceli_CP___Venn_Tutorial.pdf).

The function that implements the Venn-ABERS Predictor is `ScoresToMultiProbs()`.

```python
p0,p1 = ScoresToMultiProbs(calibrPts,testScores)
```

calibrPts: a list of pairs (score,label) corresponding to the scores and labels of the calibration examples. The score is a float and the label is an integer  meant to take values 0 or 1.

testScores: a list of floats corresponding to the scores for the test objects.

The function returns a pair of Numpy arrays with the probabilistic predictions.
